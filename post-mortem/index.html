<h1> Gecko Blaster </h1>
<h2> A Post Mortem </h2>

<h3> Background </h3>
<p>
<a href="https://js13kgames.com/">Js13kGames</a> is an annual
game jam that challenges developers to
craft a game within a measly 13KB limit. The tools at your
disposal are plain old HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. No fancy
fonts or frameworks ‚Äî just the basics. These limitations
encourage creativity. In a web landscape dominated by bloated
libraries, convoluted tooling, and an overwhelming torrent of
new versions, it's refreshing to step back and build something
from scratch.
</p>

<h3> The Theme </h3>
<p>
This year's theme was Triskaidekaphobia, or fear of the
number 13. Hmm... okay, so something spooky? Honestly,
I couldn‚Äôt think of a killer hook for the theme, and with
time running out, I decided to just get cracking. I had a
clear idea of the kind of game I wanted to make:
<ul class="boom">
<li> Fast paced, frentic and fun. </li>
<li> Retro style, evoking the glory days of 8bit/16bit games
(yep, I'm showing my age!) </li>
<li> Mobile-friendly. Although mobile gaming hasn‚Äôt quite lived
up to its early promise, it can still provide a fun-filled five
minutes.</li>
</ul>
</p>


<h3>The idea</h3>
<p>
I've always wanted to make a top-down shoot 'em up, so that was
a logical starting point. After brainstorming and a few false
starts, I landed on the rather random idea of a gecko racing
through a desert filled with enemies and... donuts. <br />

<h3> Controls </h3>
<p>
I experimented with an on-screen joystick where speed increased
as you moved your finger or thumb further from the center.
Sounded good on paper, but it felt too clunky in practice.

</p>
<p>
Next, I tried dividing the screen into five lanes with swipe
controls for horizontal movement‚Äîsimilar to Subway Surfers.
Again, it didn‚Äôt feel natural or fun, especially in the cramped
2D play area.
</p>
<p>
On-screen buttons? Not my thing. They lack the tactile feel
of physical buttons and take up valuable screen space.
</p>
<p>
Finally, I settled on a control scheme where the character
moves by dragging on the screen. Simple, and it works equally
well with a mouse for desktop players. Using an auto-fire
mechanism eliminated the need for a separate fire button,
keeping things clean.
</p>

<h3> Graphics </h3>
<p>
Since I'm not much of a pixel artist, I hid my lack of skill
behind a low-rez design and 
<a href="http://androidarts.com/palette/16pal.htm">
a tried-and-tested color palette.</a>
Most sprites are around 8x8 pixels, and the canvas size is a
mere 270x480.
</p>
<div class="imgs big animate">
  <img src="../a/gecko.gif" alt="Image of Gecko">
  <img src="../a/skull.gif" alt="Image of skull">
  <img src="../a/donut.gif" alt="Image of a tasty donut">
  <img src="../a/cactus.gif" alt="Image of cactus">
  <img src="../a/pup.gif" alt="Image of a firefly">
  <img src="../a/bat.gif" alt="Image of bat">
  <img src="../a/spider.gif" alt="Image of spider">
  <img src="../a/worm.gif" alt="Image of worm">
  <img src="../a/boss.gif" alt="Image of end boss">
</div>

<p>
Background images are tiled and drawn to a separate canvas,
then saved as a single image to reduce the number of draw
calls. Anytime a sprite needed to be scaled, flipped, or
recolored, it is saved as an in-game image to avoid repeating
expensive operations. This had a positive impact
on performance: mobile Chrome and Safari held steady at 60
FPS, while Firefox hovered around respectable 50 FPS.
</p>

<p>
In total, there are 25 images in the game, taking up
3,470 bytes.
</p>

<h3> SFX </h3>
<p>
<a href="https://github.com/KilledByAPixel/ZzFX">ZZfx</a>
is the JavaScript game developer's best friend. It has
a tiny footprint, is simple to integrate, and produces cool
sounds. The <a href="https://killedbyapixel.github.io/ZzFX/">
online generator
</a>allowed me to quickly generate
and tweak effects.
</p>

<h3> Music </h3>
<p>
<a href="https://keithclark.github.io/ZzFXM/">ZZfxM</a>, an
extension of ZZfx, features some awesome chiptune
examples. Initially, I used the tune ‚ÄúDepp,‚Äù which fit the
game perfectly. However, I later realized that I didn‚Äôt
have permission to use it.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://keithclark.github.io/ZzFXM/tracker/">ZZfxM‚Äôs
tracker</a> is an excellent piece of software, but my musical
expertise
is even more lacking than my pixel-pushing skills, so I
struggled to come up with an original soundtrack. As the
deadline loomed, I grabbed a free Pico-8 tune and played it
back using the excellent
<a href="https://github.com/codyebberson/pico8-music">
Pico-8 music player.
</a>
</a>Thankfully,
the final game stayed within the 13,312-byte limit‚Äîbut only
just!

WARNING: Last-minute changes invite disaster and are the
equivalent of deploying to production on a Friday afternoon.

<h3> Bling </h3>
<p> Or, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fy0aCDmgnxg">
        Juice it or lose it</a>.
The following techniques were put to use to make the game 'pop'
</p>
<p>
<ul class="boom">
<li>Plenty of explosions and particles to create general mayhem.</li>
<li>Screen shake and flash when certain enemies die</li>
<li> Our Gecko's tail is not static but moves in tune with the
player's movements. </li>
</ul>

<h3> What went well </h3>

<p>
<ul class="good">
<li>
Building on code from previous jams meant I concentrated on the game.
</li>
<li>
Keeping things simple with a defined scope.
</li>
<li>
Adding a soundtrack, using pico8-music
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/lifthrasiir/roadroller">
Using Roadroller</a>
</li>
</ul>
</p>


<h3> What didn't </h3>
<p>
<ul class="bad">
<li>
Started too late and didn't have time to get others to play test
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Ok, ok just lemme play the game!</h3>
