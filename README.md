## How To Play

*Mile 13 in the Desert of Doom is feared by all Geckos.*
*After all, they know that evil things lurk there*
*...but, Mile 13 is also home to the best donuts.*

Can you brave your fear of Mile 13 to munch on sweet treats?

Drag your finger on the screen to move our little gecko friend.
You can also use the mouse.

- Collect power-ups to increase firepower.
- Eat all the donuts.
- Defeat the evil dude at the end of the desert.
- Oh, and try to stay alive.

Good luck you'll need it!
